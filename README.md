## ✨ Project Overview

This predictive analytics project, developed as part of a **personal portfolio initiative** in **October 2025**, demonstrates end-to-end machine learning capabilities for supply chain risk management. The project showcases expertise in:

- 🤖 **Machine Learning** - Predictive modeling with scikit-learn
- 📊 **Feature Engineering** - Creating meaningful business metrics
- 🔍 **Risk Assessment** - Evaluating supplier ethical compliance
- 📈 **Data Analysis** - Exploratory data analysis and insights
- 🎯 **Business Intelligence** - Translating predictions into actions

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- 🔮 **Predict disruption risks** based on historical patterns
- ⚖️ **Evaluate supplier ethics** for labor practices and sustainability
- 📊 **Generate risk scores** for proactive decision making
- 🌍 **Analyze geopolitical factors** affecting supply chains
- 💼 **Provide actionable insights** for procurement teams

### 💡 Why I Built This Project

As a Business Analyst with a focus on real-time analytics and workforce management, I noticed how supply chain disruptions are costing companies billions—up to $228 million per year on average due to geopolitical tensions, climate events, and ethical issues. I wanted to create a tool that not only predicts risks but also ensures suppliers meet modern ethical standards like labor practices and sustainability.

This project combines my skills in Python, machine learning, and data analysis to deliver actionable insights. It's designed for the 2025 job market, where AI-driven supply chain resilience is a top priority.

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

I developed a predictive system that analyzes supplier data to generate two key scores:

### 📉 Disruption Risk Score (0-100)
Predicts the likelihood of supply chain disruptions based on:
- Historical disruption patterns
- Geopolitical stability in supplier regions
- Lead time variations and reliability metrics
- Order quantity and dependency factors

### ⚖️ Ethics Compliance Score (0-100)
Evaluates supplier adherence to ethical standards:
- Labor practices and working conditions
- Environmental sustainability
- Corporate social responsibility
- Regulatory compliance

## 📊 Sample Outputs

### 🔮 Predictions Generated

**High-Risk Suppliers Identified:**
- Supplier A: 87% disruption risk, 45% ethics score
- Supplier B: 72% disruption risk, 60% ethics score
- Supplier C: 55% disruption risk, 35% ethics score

### 📈 Key Insights

- **Geopolitical Risk:** 40% of high-risk suppliers in unstable regions
- **Lead Time Variance:** Suppliers with >20% variance show 3x disruption risk
